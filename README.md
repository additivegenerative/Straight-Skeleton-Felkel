[Straight Skeleton Algorithm by Felkel](https://github.com/Botffy/polyskel) was implemented in Python 3 by Botffy. I read the [paper](http://www.dma.fi.upm.es/personal/mabellanas/tfcs/skeleton/html/documentacion/Straight%20Skeletons%20Implementation.pdf) and when I was about to implement, I found Botffy's github repo. I went through his code and understood his implementation. I thought explaining his code along with my handwritten notes might be a good way for others to understand the code and logic.

You can also run the file Felkel_Implementation-vc-edits.py script to get skeleton output
